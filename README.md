# Grabby

Grabby is an early prototype that automatically discovers postential custom attributes to be reported
into New Relic Insights.  You then specify which attributes you want to collect, and then Grabby will report
them.

Grabby depends on a recent version of the New Relic Agent (3.9.1 or later) and any Rails application
v2 or later.
